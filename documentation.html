  <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
    To start my visual design process I first studied the Cereal dataset to determine questions and then I assessed what type of visualization would fit the attributes I wished to analyze. While looking through the cereal dataset and it’s 10 attributes, I found that the cereals could be identified by their manufacturer and cereal names. Since it is common to see the nutritional value for individual cereals, I instead decided to see which manufacturer has the highest sugar and sodium contents. High sugar and sodium content in food can lead to many health risks. Therefore, I chose to ask questions and visualize these data points because they are important in eating a healthy and well-balanced diet.

    When deciding the type of visualization to use, I compared the benefits of histograms, bar and pie charts, and line graphs. Since the data is not time oriented or percentage based, the bar chart was a better fit than the line graph and pie chart. To begin the design process I first found an intuitive chart template through The D3 Graph Gallery. Then I began sketching the different way I could visualize my questions to best find correlation between manufacturers and nutritional values. See my sketch iteraterations below:

    While designing the Sugar and Sodium charts I took a few variables into account: functionality, accessibility, and aesthetics. While my skill set in web development (specifically JS and D3.js) is very limited, my goal was to create a visualization to clearly depict the relationships between nutritional value and cereal manufacturers.

    For colors, I looked for a palette to match the bright and vibrant colors seen in cereal branding. I chose to use a black font for the labels and bright orange for the hovering info to emphasize the bar and axis labels. I also checked to ensure these colors are visible and distinguishable throughout the process by using the Colorblinding chrome extension. The placement of the two charts is done so that users can easily switch between the two. The user is able to directly see any changes between the sodium content and sugar content of the manufacturers.

    This clear transition between the two charts proved effective as I found that, while sugar and sodium are measured differently, the manufacturers’ sugar and sodium content distribution was almost identical in both charts. This is seen as both visualizations look almost identical in all cases except for manufacturer A. Overall, the charts effectively answered the proposed questions regarding what manufacturers produce the highest values. According to the chart, Kellogs and General Mills have the highest amount of both ingredients. These two manufacturers both have over double the amount of sugar and sodium the third place manufacturer, Ralston Purina, contains
